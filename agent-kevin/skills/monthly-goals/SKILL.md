# Monthly Goals

Strategic, not tactical. 2-4 themes max. Each theme has a concrete success criterion you'll evaluate against next month.

## Inputs

1. **Last month's themes** — read previous `## Monthly Goals` block from `<HOME>/projects/TASKS.md` (if it exists).
2. **What landed in the last month** — task closures, knowledge commits.
3. **Active projects** — `<HOME>/projects/` directories, each project's README for vision/status.
4. **Your durable preferences** — `<HOME>/USER.md`.

## Compose

```
🗓️ Month of <Month YYYY>

📊 Last month's report card
  - <each prior theme>: <hit / partial / dropped> — <one-line evidence>

🎯 This month's themes (2-4 max)
  1. <theme name>
     - Why this matters now: <1 line>
     - Success looks like: <concrete criterion you can evaluate>
     - Primary projects: <slugs>
  2. ...

⛔ What I'm NOT doing this month
  - <intentional deferrals>
```

## Persist

Offer to update `<HOME>/projects/TASKS.md` — replace **only** the `## Monthly Goals` block inside the `<!-- GOALS:START -->...<!-- GOALS:END -->` markers with the new month's content. Leave `## Weekly Goals` and the auto-generated task-list sections outside the markers alone. Don't auto-write; confirm first.

## Anti-patterns

- ❌ More than 4 themes. Monthly is for big bets, not a backlog.
- ❌ Themes that are project names ("My-project this month"). Themes are outcomes, not areas.
- ❌ Skipping the report card. Closing the loop on last month is the whole point of monthly cadence.
